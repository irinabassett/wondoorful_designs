            <p>What is soap? you're nothing but pure evil! just like the newspaper comics! i had 4 biscuits and then i ate one. then i only had 3! squidward, your ceiling is talking to me.</p>

            <h2>Paint Parties</h2>
            <p>Did you order twenty cases of... ripped pants?! i'll never forget your one-hundred-percent all-secret patty, secretly assembled with undersea cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion, all secretly steaming between two fluffy seaweed sea buns. well, we're both invertebrates, aren't we?.</p>

            <p> Woke with fright in the middle of the night, to find that his dream had come true! don't stand too close to a squirrel, billy. you'll catch its stupid. yeah, uhh... i'm with the pet hospital down the street and i understand you have a dying animal on the premises...</p>

            <h2>Fundraising</h2>
            <p>That's it mister! you just lost your brain priviliges! you mean what we thought they thought we think and thought they thought? it's not just any boulder... ... ..it's a rock! you're a man now, spongebob, and it's time you started acting like one. well, it may be stupid, but it's also dumb. moss always points to civilization.</p>
                    
            <p>I am the master at kara-tay. you can't fool me. i listen to public radio! it's a vast swirling wonderland of sparkling white pleasure. let it fill your senses with cascading fluffy pillows of excitement, and comfort, as you've never felt before.</p>
