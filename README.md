# Wondoorful Designs

# Description
Arts and crafts website that provides information about paint parties and fundraising oportunities, shopping for blank templates and completed door hangers, and blog.

# Custom CSS Classes
The classes I created are:

1. .tag -- Centers the text, adds background and font colors, changes the thickness of the text, adds padding and margins, rounds the corners, and allows tag elements to behave like a table element. 
  
2. .profile-image -- Repostions the image to fit content and centers it, sets margins, resizes the image, adds color border, and rounds it. 

3. .card and .aboutCard-- Adds margins and padding, stretches the text so that each line has equal width, adds background color, adds top and bottom color borders, adds box shadows. 

# Custom JavaScript Functions
The javascript functions I created are:

1. openNav() -- The function slides in the side navigation, and pushes the page content to the right, adds a background color with 60% opacity to the body element. 

2. closeNav() -- This function closes/hides the side navigation, returns page content and background color to originals.
