# Wondoorful Designs

# Description
Arts and crafts website that provides information for paint parties and fundraising oportunities, shopping for blank templates and completed door hangers. 

# Custom CSS Classes
The class(es) I created are:

1. .tag -- Centers the text, adds background and font colors, changes the thickness of the text, adds padding and margins, rounds the corners, and allows tag elements to behave like a table element. 
  
2. .sidenav -- Sets the height from top to bottom, sets the width to 0, keeps the side navigation in place and on top, changes background color, disables horizontal scroll, adds padding, and gives 0.5 second transition effect to slide in the sidenav.

3. .card -- Adds margins and padding, sets max-widths to 650px to even out containers, stretches the text so that each line has equal width, add background color, adds top and bottom borders. 

# Custom JavaScript Functions
The javascript functions I created are:

1. openNav() -- The function slides in the side navigation, and pushes the page content to the right, adds a background color with a 40% opacity to the body element. 

2. closeNav() -- This function closes/hides the side navigation, returns page content and background color to original.
